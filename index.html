        React is maintained by Facebook and Instagram. React is designed to be a simple library that allows developers to focus on the "View" aspect of a webpage.
        React allows developers to create large web-applications that use data and can change over time without reloading the page. It aims primarily to provide speed, simplicity, and scalability.
        React is slowly taking over JavaScript front end web dev frameworks. Angular is still the biggest network in absolute terms but React is quickly catching up.
        React Native is a very efficient tool for native mobile development. Redux is inevitable going to be used by React developers.
        Angular contains pretty much anything a web developer will ever need. 

        In this way it is advantageous because you do not have to rely on third-party libraries for things like HTTP requests.
        However the system can feel cluttered as it kind of forces you to do everything the "Angular way."
        This might be a good thing if you have a large team working on alarge scale project as code will be consistent and therefore easier to debug.
        On the other hand this gives you less freedom in the designer and developer elements.

        React on the other hand is faster as it uses a virtual DOM rather than an integrated one. React also has a much easier learning curve.
        This likely explains the greater satisfaction with React than with Angular. Angular uses the "Modal View Controller" system to keep components separate to each other.
        This is more methodical and systematic from a purely software design perspective. On the other hand people who are not proficient developers find this intimidating and prefer only dealing with the View element as React allows you to do.

        Angular was a ground-up rewrite of AngularJS.
        Angular does not have a concept of "scope" or controllers, instead it uses a hierarchy of components as its main architectural concept
        Angular has a different expression syntax, focusing on "[ ]" for property binding, and "( )" for event binding
        TypeScript is a superset of ECMAScript 6 (ES6), and is backwards compatible with ECMAScript 5 (i.e.: JavaScript). Angular also includes ES6:

        Vue.js aims to be a more approachable framework than React and Angular. The core library focuses on component composition.
        More advanced features such as routing, state management and build tooling are maintained via libraries and packages supported by Vue.js.

        Vue.js was created by Evan You. 
        You was working at Google using Angular.js and wanted a framework which had as many features as Angular but was easier to learn.

        Vue uses an HTML-based template syntax that allows you to declaratively bind the rendered DOM to the underlying Vue instanceâ€™s data. All Vue templates are valid HTML that can be parsed by spec-compliant browsers and HTML parsers. Under the hood, Vue compiles the templates into virtual DOM render functions.
        Combined with the reactivity system, Vue is able to intelligently figure out the minimal number of components to re-render and apply the minimal amount of DOM manipulation when the app state changes.
