        This is the ultimate website. Sonic please do not try to take my chaos emeralds. Luigi will gobble you up with his vacumn cleaner.
        Bowser is just sitting over there with Captain Falcon. Tonight Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic play at the Australian Open.

        Grigor Dimitrov won his match yesterday. That is good. Richard Gasquet also played quite well. Gasquet could not get into Federer's serve though.
        Berdych is also playing very well in his matches. Berdych should be able to challenge Federer in the quarters.

        React is slowly taking over JavaScript front end web dev frameworks. Angular is still the biggest network in absolute terms but React is quickly catching up.
        React Native is a very efficient tool for native mobile development. Redux is inevitable going to be used by React developers.
        Angular contains pretty much anything a web developer will ever need. 
        In this way it is advantageous because you do not have to rely on third-party libraries for things like HTTP requests.
        However the system can feel cluttered as it kind of forces you to do everything the "Angular way."
        This might be a good thing if you have a large team working on alarge scale project as code will be consistent and therefore easier to debug.
        On the other hand this gives you less freedom in the designer and developer elements.

        React on the other hand is faster as it uses a virtual DOM rather than an integrated one. React also has a much easier learning curve.
        This likely explains the greater satisfaction with React than with Angular. Angular uses the "Modal View Controller" system to keep components separate to each other.
        This is more methodical and systematic from a purely software design perspective. On the other hand people who are not proficient developers find this intimidating and prefer only dealing with the View element as React allows you to do.
